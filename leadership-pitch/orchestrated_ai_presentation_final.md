::::
:::::

**Key Distinction**: mars-dev builds MARS, research-project uses MARS

---

## Research Project Structure

**How you'll use MARS:**

```
your-research-project/           # Your repository
├── .mars/                       # MARS configuration overrides
│   ├── config/                  # Project-specific settings
│   └── docker-compose.override.yml  # Customize services
├── src/
│   ├── framework/               # MARS submodule (read-only)
│   └── algorithms/              # Your research code
├── data/                        # Your research data
├── results/                     # Your experiment results
├── notebooks/                   # Your Jupyter notebooks
├── scripts/                     # Your analysis scripts
└── README.md                    # Your documentation
```

**Critical Principle**: MARS framework is read-only. All customization goes in `.mars/` directory.

---

## Configuration: MARS vs. Your Project

**Two separate configuration mechanisms:**

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="48%"}

**mars-dev Configuration**
- 🔧 **For**: Building MARS
- 📂 **Location**: `mars-dev/` internal files
- ⚙️ **Controls**: Development tools
  - E8 orchestration
  - Pre-commit hooks
  - Sprint templates
  - Test infrastructure
- 👤 **User**: MARS developers
- 🚫 **Not in research-project**: Development infrastructure stays separate

::::
:::: {.column width="48%"}

**research-project Configuration**
- 🔬 **For**: Using MARS
- 📂 **Location**: `.mars/` directory
- ⚙️ **Controls**: MARS services
  - LLM models (which AI to use)
  - Service ports
  - Resource limits
  - Domain-specific agents
- 👤 **User**: Research teams
- ✅ **Overrides MARS defaults**: Your project, your rules

::::
:::::

**Example**: Change Neo4j port for your project → edit `.mars/docker-compose.override.yml`

---

## MARS External Dependencies

**MARS is built on 5 external repositories (git submodules):**

| Dependency | Type | Purpose | Status |
|------------|------|---------|--------|
| **LiteLLM** | Python/Docker | AI gateway (AskSage/CAPRA access) | ✅ Production |
| **Zotero MCP** | Python MCP | Literature management tools | ✅ Production (95% complete) |
| **GitLab MCP** | Node.js MCP | 40+ GitLab integration tools | ✅ Production (50% complete) |
| **Zotero Server** | Docker Compose | Self-hosted reference server | ✅ Evaluation |
| **Session Exporter** | Python CLI | CCC session archival | ✅ Integrated |

**What "git submodule" means**: Version-controlled dependencies - reproducible builds, no surprises

**For researchers**: You don't manage these - they're pre-integrated

---

## MARS vs. mars-dev: The CLIs

**Two command-line interfaces with different audiences:**

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="48%"}

**mars-dev CLI**
- 🔧 **For**: Building MARS
- 👤 **User**: MARS developers (me)
- 📦 **Commands**: Infrastructure operations
  - `mars-dev up` - Start development container
  - `mars-dev down` - Stop development

::::
:::::

**You'll use**: `mars` CLI (research-project). You'll never need `mars-dev` CLI.

---

## How Research Projects Get MARS

**Simple 3-step process:**

**Step 1: Add MARS as submodule**
```bash
cd your-research-project
git submodule add https://github.com/nasa/mars-v2 src/framework
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Step 2: Create `.mars/` configuration**
```bash
mkdir -p .mars/config
# Customize MARS for your project (optional)
```

**Step 3: Start MARS**
```bash
cd src/framework
source mars-env.config  # Load MARS environment
mars up -d              # Start MARS services
```

**That's it!** MARS is running. Now write your research code.

## Documentation: Two Audiences

**Current State**: Documentation is messy (`docs/wiki/` will be reorganized)

**Future State**: Modular documentation architecture aligned with users

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="48%"}

**For Developers (Building MARS)**
- 🔧 **Audience**: MARS developers (me)
- 📂 **Location**: Within module directories
- 📦 **Structure**:
  - `core/docs/` - Core framework
  - `mars-dev/docs/` - Dev tools
  - `modules/*/docs/` - Module-specific
- 📝 **Content**:
  - ADRs (architecture decisions)
  - Implementation details
  - Development workflows
  - Testing strategies

::::
:::: {.column width="48%"}

**For Researchers (Using MARS)**
- 🔬 **Audience**: Research teams (you)
- 📂 **Location**: Generated GitLab wiki
- 📦 **Structure**:
  - Getting Started guides
  - Use case examples
  - Configuration reference
  - Troubleshooting
- 📝 **Content**:
  - How to use MARS services
  - Research workflows
  - Agent capabilities
  - Integration examples

::::
:::::

**Key Principle**: Documentation lives where it's maintained, aggregated where it's consumed

---

## Modular Documentation Architecture

**Current mess** (everything in `docs/wiki/`):
```
docs/wiki/
├── adr/           # ALL 36 ADRs mixed together
├── integrations/  # Mixed module concerns
├── tools/         # Mixed concerns
└── ...            # 150+ files, unclear ownership
```

**Future organization** (modular, clear ownership):
```
core/docs/                    # Core framework docs
mars-dev/docs/                # Development infrastructure
modules/
├── agents/
│   ├── shared/docs/          # All agents
│   └── orchestrator/docs/    # Specific agent
└── services/
    ├── shared/docs/          # All services
    └── ollama/docs/          # Specific service
```

**Benefits**: Clear ownership, module independence, easy discovery

---

## Documentation Types & Organization

**Every module (`core/`, `mars-dev/`, `modules/*/`) has same structure:**

| Directory | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **adr/** | Architecture decisions | Design choices, trade-offs |
| **educational/** | Learn the technology | Concepts, tutorials |
| **setup/** | Configuration & usage | Install, configure, run |
| **architecture/** | Implementation details | Internal design, patterns |
| **mcp/** | MCP tool reference | API documentation (services) |
| **testing/** | Test documentation | Test strategy, coverage |
| **troubleshooting/** | Fix issues | Common problems, solutions |

**ADR Numbering**: Per-directory (core/ADR-0001, mars-dev/ADR-0001, ollama/ADR-0001)

**Cross-references**: Use path for clarity ("`mars-dev/ADR-0004`" = Modular Documentation)

---

## Generated Wiki (Aggregation)

**Source of truth**: Documentation lives in module directories (git-tracked)

**GitLab wiki**: Aggregated view (generated automatically)

```
docs/wiki/                    # Generated, NOT hand-edited
├── adr/
│   ├── core/                 # From core/docs/adr/
│   ├── mars-dev/             # From mars-dev/docs/adr/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── shared/           # From modules/agents/shared/docs/adr/
│   │   └── orchestrator/     # From modules/agents/orchestrator/docs/adr/
│   └── services/
│       └── ollama/           # From modules/services/ollama/docs/adr/
├── educational/              # Same structure
├── setup/                    # Same structure
└── cross-cutting/            # Strategic docs (VISION, ROADMAP)
    ├── VISION.md
    └── ROADMAP.md
```

**Workflow**: Edit module docs → Script aggregates → GitLab wiki updates

**Benefit**: Single source of truth, multiple views (module-local, centralized wiki)

---

## Self-Hosted GitLab (Security)

**Why self-hosted GitLab inside MARS?**

**Security requirement**: Classified research code cannot leave the network

**Architecture**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MARS Runtime Container                  │
│                                          │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │ GitLab CE (Self-Hosted)        │    │
│  │ - All repos stored locally     │    │
│  │ - No external network access   │    │
│  │ - Complete version control     │    │
│  │ - Issues, MRs, wikis           │    │
│  └────────────────────────────────┘    │
│                                          │
│  Access: localhost:9080 (inside MARS)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits**: Air-gap capable, no data leakage, full git functionality

---

## GitLab Sync (Collaboration)

**Problem**: Self-hosted GitLab is isolated - how to collaborate with team?

**Solution**: Automated bidirectional sync with organizational GitLab

**Architecture**:
```
MARS GitLab (Isolated)  <---Sync--->  Org GitLab (External)
  localhost:9080                      gitlab.org.example.com
  - Classified research               - Unclassified/reviewed code
  - Daily development                 - Team collaboration
  - Full history                      - External review
```

**Sync Mechanism**:
- **260 automated tests**, 90%+ coverage
- **Bidirectional**: Pull team updates, push your work
- **Safe**: Agents stopped during sync, network temporarily enabled
- **Audited**: Complete operation logging

**User workflow**: `mars sync:pull` (morning), `mars sync:push` (evening)

---

## GitLab Sync Details

**Three key operations:**

**1. Pull updates** (get team changes):
```bash
mars sync:pull mars-v2
# 1. Stop agents (30s)
# 2. Enable network temporarily
# 3. Pull from org GitLab
# 4. Disable network (restore isolation)
# 5. Restart agents
# Duration: 30-90 seconds
```

**2. Push work** (share your commits):
```bash
mars sync:push mars-v2
# Same 5-step process, but pushes instead
```

**3. Check status** (see pending changes):
```bash
mars sync:status
# Shows: commits to pull, commits to push
```

**Safety**: Full audit logging, backup/rollback, metadata sync (issues/MRs/wikis)

## The Modularity Ladder

**The Progression**:
- 🏠 **Level 0**: Custom Home (6-12 months per capability - monolithic)
- 🏗️ **Level 1**: Prefab Sections (3-6 months - brittle integration)
- 🏢 **Level 2**: Apartment Building (1-3 months - microservices)
- 🏨 **Level 3**: Modular Hotel (3-7 weeks per new domain - plug-and-play)

![Modularity Ladder](diagrams/png/modularity-ladder.png){ width=85% }

---

## Level 0: Custom Home (Monolithic)

🏠 **The Analogy**: Building a custom house from scratch every time

**Characteristics**:
- **6-12 months per capability**
- Everything built from ground up
- No reusable components
- Tightly coupled code
- Hard to modify or extend

**Example**: Traditional AI research system
- Build authentication system
- Build storage system
- Build compute infrastructure
- Build AI integration
- Build user interface
- Every component custom-built and interconnected

**MARS Comparison**: Traditional approach takes 6-12 months with 3-5 FTE. MARS Level 3 delivers same capability in 3-7 weeks with 1-2 FTE.

**Problem**: Every new research domain requires rebuilding everything.

---

## Level 1: Prefab Sections (Brittle Integration)

🏗️ **The Analogy**: Using prefabricated walls but custom-fitting each connection

**Characteristics**:
- **3-6 months per capability**
- Some reusable components
- Manual integration required
- Brittle connections between parts
- Version conflicts common

**Example**: Docker containers with custom glue code
- Container for database
- Container for AI service
- Container for web server
- Custom scripts to connect them
- Configuration files manually synced

**Integration Issues**:
- Service A expects JSON, Service B sends XML
- Container 1 uses Python 3.8, Container 2 needs 3.11
- Network configs conflict between services
- Updates to one service break others

**MARS Comparison**: Level 3 uses standardized MCP protocol - no brittle glue code needed.

---

## Level 2: Apartment Building (Microservices)

🏢 **The Analogy**: Shared foundation with independent units

**Characteristics**:
- **1-3 months per capability**
- Microservices architecture
- Shared infrastructure
- APIs for communication
- Better isolation than Level 1

**Example**: Docker Compose with multiple services
- Shared Docker network
- Shared storage volumes
- API-based communication
- Independent deployment of services

**MARS Partial Example**:
- Neo4j knowledge graph service
- MLflow experiment tracking service
- MinIO object storage service
- Services communicate via REST APIs

**Remaining Challenges**:
- Still need custom integration code
- API versioning complexities
- Service discovery overhead
- No standardized agent protocol

**MARS Comparison**: Level 3 adds MCP standardization - agents plug in instantly.

---

## Level 3: Modular Hotel (Plug-and-Play)

🏨 **The Analogy**: Hotel with foundation built once, rooms added as needed

**Characteristics**:
- **3-7 weeks per new domain**
- Foundation built once and shared
- Plug-and-play modules
- Standardized interfaces (MCP protocol)
- 90% foundation reuse

**MARS "Hotel Rooms" Architecture**:

**Foundation (Built Once)**:
- Docker orchestration
- Neo4j knowledge graph
- MinIO object storage
- LiteLLM AI gateway
- Squid security proxy
- MLflow experiment tracking

**Modular "Rooms" (Add As Needed)**:
- Agents (lit-monitor, orchestrator, testczar)
- Services (Zotero, GitLab)
- Domain workflows (materials, chemistry, biology)

**Standardized Interfaces**:
- **MCP protocol**: Model Context Protocol for agent communication
- Agents register available tools/capabilities
- Other agents discover and invoke them
- No custom integration code needed

**Example - Adding Materials Domain**:
- Week 1: Use existing foundation (0 hrs)
- Weeks 2-4: Build materials agents (80-120 hrs)
- Weeks 5-7: Add domain tools (40-80 hrs)
- **Total: 3-7 weeks, 1-2 FTE**

**vs. Traditional**: 6-12 months, 3-5 FTE

**MARS Status**: ✅ **Production-ready modular architecture**

---

## Modularity Ladder: Why It Matters

**Speed to New Capabilities**:
- Level 0: 6-12 months → Level 3: 3-7 weeks (75% time savings)
- Level 0: 3-5 FTE → Level 3: 1-2 FTE (50% cost savings)

**Reduced Risk**:
- Shared foundation = well-tested, proven infrastructure
- New modules inherit security, observability, reliability
- Failures isolated to individual modules

**Scaling Research**:
- Add new research domains rapidly
- Researchers focus on science, not infrastructure
- Cross-domain insights via shared knowledge graph

**Technology Evolution**:
- Swap AI models without rebuilding (LiteLLM abstraction)
- Upgrade infrastructure without touching research code
- MCP protocol enables future agent ecosystems

**Real-World Impact**:
- Materials group operational in 5-7 weeks (not 6-12 months)
- Chemistry group reuses 90% of infrastructure
- Biology group reuses same foundation
- Each new domain accelerates the next

---

## Modularity Example: Materials Group

**Timeline**: 5-7 weeks (vs. 6-12 months from scratch)

| Week | Activity | Effort | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Week 1** | Use existing | 0 hrs | Zotero, GitLab, KG (immediate) |
| **Weeks 2-4** | Materials agents | 80-120 hrs | lit-monitor, KG schema, exp-design |
| **Weeks 5-6** | Custom tools | 40-80 hrs | LAMMPS, VASP integration |
| **Total** | **5-7 weeks** | **120-200 hrs** | **90% foundation reuse** |

**Cost Comparison**: Monolithic = 6-12 mo, 3-5 FTE | MARS = 5-7 wk, 1-2 FTE
**Savings**: 75% time, 50% FTE

---

## The Security Ladder

**The Progression**:
- 🚪 **Level 0**: Open Door (public research only)
- 🔑 **Level 1**: Lock & Key (limited classified use)
- 🏘️ **Level 2**: Gated Community (some classified with waivers)
- 🏛️ **Level 3**: Military Base (DoD classified, air-gap capable)

![Security Ladder](diagrams/png/security-ladder.png){ width=85% }

---

## Level 0: Open Door (Public Research)

🚪 **The Analogy**: Building with no security - anyone can enter

**Characteristics**:
- **No security controls**
- Cloud-hosted AI (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Data leaves your network
- Public internet access required
- No classification support

**Example**: ChatGPT Plus, Claude.ai
- Convenient but data goes to cloud
- Cannot handle CUI/classified
- Vendor controls your data
- Internet outage = no access

**Appropriate For**: Public research, open-source projects, unclassified work only

---

## Level 1: Lock & Key (Limited Classified)

🔑 **The Analogy**: Building with basic locks, but windows still open

**Characteristics**:
- **Basic security** (authentication, HTTPS)
- Some data stays local
- Limited classified use (waivers required)
- Still dependent on external services
- Partial air-gap support

**Example**: GitHub Copilot Enterprise
- Data stays in your tenant
- Authentication required
- But: Still calls external APIs
- But: Limited control over model

**Appropriate For**: CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information), some sensitive research

---

## Level 2: Gated Community (Some Classified)

🏘️ **The Analogy**: Gated neighborhood with security checkpoints

**Characteristics**:
- **Enhanced security** (network isolation)
- Self-hosted infrastructure
- Some classified with waivers
- Reduced external dependencies
- Monitored access

**Example**: Private cloud deployments
- Self-hosted LLM infrastructure
- Network segmentation
- Access logging
- But: May still need external model APIs
- But: Not fully air-gap capable

**Appropriate For**: Sensitive research, some classified work with security waivers

---

## Level 3: Military Base (DoD Classified)

🏛️ **The Analogy**: Military installation with multiple security layers

**Characteristics**:
- **Production-ready for DoD classified**
- 100% self-hosted (no external calls)
- Air-gap capable
- Deny-by-default networking
- Full audit logging

**MARS Security Features**:

**Network Security**:
- **Squid proxy**: Deny-by-default (explicit allowlist)
- Air-gap capable (no internet required)
- All external calls blocked unless approved

**Container Security**:
- **Sysbox**: Rootless containers (UID/GID isolation)
- No privileged containers
- Kernel namespace isolation

**Authentication**:
- **Bearer token auth**: DoD PKI/CAC support
- Certificate-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

**Data Security**:
- **100% self-hosted**: Local LLMs via Ollama
- No data leaves network
- Encrypted at rest and in transit

**Audit & Compliance**:
- **Append-only logging**: Full provenance tracking
- Tamper-proof audit trail
- Classification label propagation

**MARS Status**: ✅ **Production-ready for classified networks**

---

## Security Ladder: Why It Matters

**The Progression**:
- **Level 0**: Convenient but insecure (cloud AI services)
- **Level 1**: Basic protection (some local control)
- **Level 2**: Enhanced security (mostly self-hosted)
- **Level 3**: DoD classified capable (full air-gap, zero trust)

**MARS Today**: Level 3 operational
- Air-gap deployments ready
- DoD classified network capable
- 100% self-hosted (no external dependencies)
- Deny-by-default security posture

**Why This Matters**:
- **Classified research**: Can use AI on sensitive projects
- **Data sovereignty**: Your data never leaves your network
- **Mission assurance**: Works without internet access
- **Compliance**: Meets DoD security requirements

**Competitive Advantage**: Most AI tools are Level 0-1 (cloud-dependent). MARS is Level 3 (classified-capable).

# Part 6: Technical Implementation Details

---

## Technical Deep Dive: Overview

**Purpose**: Explain key MARS implementation choices

**Topics**:
1. Git Worktrees - Parallel development
2. AskSage Integration - DoD AI access via LiteLLM
3. Sysbox Runtime - Secure containerization
4. Git Submodules - Dependency management

**Audience**: Technical stakeholders, infrastructure teams

---

# Worktrees: Parallel Development

---

## The Problem: Linear Development Bottleneck

**Traditional Git Workflow**:
```
main branch (work blocked while testing)
    ↓
Create feature branch
    ↓
Make changes (can't work on other features)
    ↓
Test, iterate
    ↓
Merge back to main
    ↓
Switch to next feature
```

**Limitations**:
- ❌ One task at a time per repository
- ❌ Frequent context switching
- ❌ Long-running tasks block other work

## Git Worktrees: The Solution

**What is a worktree?**
> Multiple working directories for the same repository, each with its own branch

**Visual Concept**:
```
Main Repository (/workspace/mars-v2)
    ↓ branch: main

Worktree 1 (/workspace/mars-v2/mars-dev/worktrees/feature-a)
    ↓ branch: feature/a

Worktree 2 (/workspace/mars-v2/mars-dev/worktrees/feature-b)
    ↓ branch: feature/b

Worktree 3 (/workspace/mars-v2/mars-dev/worktrees/testing)
    ↓ branch: test/integration
```

**All share**: Same .git history, tags, remotes
**Each has**: Own working directory, own branch, own state

---

## Worktrees in MARS Development

![Git Worktrees Workflow](diagrams/png/git-worktrees-workflow.png){ width=85% }

**How MARS Uses Worktrees**:

**Parallel Sprint Development** (E8 Orchestration):
- **5-25 concurrent CCC sessions**, each in own worktree
- Example: Sprint 7 (Wave 2) = 8 worktrees simultaneously
- Each worktree = isolated environment for one task

**Typical MARS Worktree Structure**:
```
mars-v2/                           # Main repo (read-only during sprints)
├── mars-dev/worktrees/
│   ├── c2-zotero-fixes/          # Component 2 work
│   ├── c4-infrastructure/         # Component 4 enhancements
│   ├── s7-wave2-agent-scaffold/   # Sprint 7 task
│   ├── s7-wave2-testing/          # Parallel testing
│   └── mars-writing/              # Documentation sessions
```

---

## Worktrees: Benefits for MARS

**1. True Parallel Development**:
- Work on C2 (Zotero) while C4 (Infrastructure) builds
- Run tests in one worktree, write code in another
- Documentation in one worktree, implementation in another

**2. No Context Loss**:
- Each worktree preserves full IDE state
- Terminal history stays relevant
- No constant branch switching

**3. Isolated Testing**:
- Test changes without affecting main development
- Multiple test configurations simultaneously
- Integration testing in dedicated worktree

**4. Sprint Orchestration** (E8):
- 5-25 parallel CCC sessions (one per worktree)
- Zellij dashboard shows all sessions
- Merge queue for controlled integration

**Productivity Gain**: **40-60% faster** multi-task development

---

## Worktrees: Command Primer

**Create a worktree**:
```bash
# From main repository
git worktree add ../worktrees/feature-x -b feature/x

# Result:
# - New directory: ../worktrees/feature-x
# - New branch: feature/x (checked out in worktree)
# - Ready to work immediately
```

**List all worktrees**:
```bash
git worktree list

# Output:
# /workspace/mars-v2              abc1234 [main]
# /workspace/mars-v2/../feature-x def5678 [feature/x]
```

**Work in worktree** (completely isolated):
```bash
cd ../worktrees/feature-x
vim code.py               # Make changes
git add code.py
git commit -m "feat: Add feature X"
# Main repo unaffected, other worktrees unaffected
```

**Merge back to main**:
```bash
cd /workspace/mars-v2    # Back to main repo
git merge feature/x      # Integrate changes
```

---

## Worktrees: MARS E8 Integration

**E8 Parallel Orchestration** uses worktrees for **sprint management**:

**Sprint Planning** (`mars-dev/sprints/s7-wave2/sprint.yaml`):
```yaml
tasks:
  - id: T1-agent-scaffold
    worktree: s7-wave2-agent-scaffold
    branch: feat/s7-wave2-agent-scaffold

  - id: T2-testing
    worktree: s7-wave2-testing
    branch: feat/s7-wave2-testing
```

**Automated Worktree Creation**:
```bash
# Script: mars-dev/scripts/create-worktrees.sh
./mars-dev/scripts/create-worktrees.sh sprints/s7-wave2/sprint.yaml

# Creates 8 worktrees, 8 branches, 8 Zellij panes
# Each ready for parallel CCC session
```

**Result**: **8 tasks progressing simultaneously** instead of sequentially

---

## Worktrees: Real-World MARS Example

**Scenario**: Sprint 7 Wave 2 (8 parallel tasks)

**Setup** (1 command):
```bash
./mars-dev/scripts/launch-sprint.py sprints/s7-wave2/sprint.yaml
```

**What Happens**:
1. Creates 8 worktrees (one per task)
2. Creates 8 branches (one per task)
3. Launches Zellij dashboard (8 panes)
4. Starts 8 CCC sessions (one per pane)
5. Loads task context into each session

**Parallel Execution**:
- Pane 1: Agent scaffolding
- Pane 2: Integration testing
- Pane 3: Documentation updates
- Pane 4: ADR authoring
- Pane 5-8: Other tasks

**Merge Strategy**: Controlled queue (one worktree at a time)

**Productivity**: 8 tasks in **parallel** vs. **sequential** = **5-7× faster sprints**

# AskSage Integration

---

## The Challenge: DoD AI Access

**Problem**: Commercial AI services not allowed on classified networks

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Air-gap capable (no internet)
- ✅ DoD accredited (ATO/security review)
- ✅ Data never leaves network
- ✅ Vendor lock-in avoidance

**Traditional Solution**: Build everything from scratch
**MARS Solution**: AskSage + LiteLLM abstraction

---

## What is AskSage?

**AskSage**: Navy-hosted AI service (GPT-4, Claude, Llama)

**Architecture**:
```
Navy CAPRA Endpoint (https://capra.flankspeed.dso.mil)
    ↓ (DoD PKI authentication)
AskSage API Gateway
    ↓ (routes to available models)
Commercial AI Providers (Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock)
    ↓ (via FedRAMP connections)
LLM Models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Llama 3)
```

**Key Features**:
- 🔐 **DoD PKI authentication** (CAC/ECA required)
- 🛡️ **FedRAMP authorized** connections
- 📊 **Usage tracking** and audit logs
- 🚫 **No training** on your data (contractual)
- 💰 **Government rates** (volume discounts)

---

## AskSage vs. Commercial Anthropic

| Feature | **AskSage** | **Commercial Anthropic** |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Access** | DoD PKI (CAC/ECA) | API key (anyone) |
| **Network** | FedRAMP connection | Public internet |
| **Data Policy** | No training (contract) | No training (policy) |
| **Cost** | Gov't rates (~50% less) | Standard API rates |
| **Models** | GPT-4, Claude, Llama | Claude only |
| **Classified** | ✅ Allowed (with ATO) | ❌ Prohibited |
| **Air-Gap** | ⚠️ Partial (local fallback) | ❌ Not possible |
| **Audit** | ✅ Full DoD logging | ⚠️ Limited |

**MARS Approach**: Use AskSage for classified, Anthropic for unclassified (LiteLLM handles both)

---

## The LiteLLM Shim: Why It Matters

**Problem**: Each AI provider has different API

**OpenAI API**:
```python
import openai
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

**Anthropic API**:
```python
import anthropic
response = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

**AskSage API**:
```python
import requests
response = requests.post(
    "https://capra.flankspeed.dso.mil/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {pki_token}"},
    json={"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [...]}
)
```

**All different!** Hard-coded vendor = lock-in

---

## LiteLLM: Unified AI Gateway

![LiteLLM Architecture](diagrams/png/litellm-architecture.png){ width=85% }

**LiteLLM**: Translates all providers → OpenAI-compatible API

**MARS Architecture**:
```
MARS Agents
    ↓ (OpenAI API format - always)
LiteLLM Proxy (localhost:4000)
    ↓ (routes based on config)
┌──────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┐
AskSage        Anthropic         Ollama
(via CAPRA)    (commercial)      (local GPU)
```

**Configuration** (`litellm-config.yaml`):
```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: claude-sonnet
    litellm_params:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
      api_base: https://capra.flankspeed.dso.mil/v1
      api_key: ${ASKSAGE_API_KEY}

  - model_name: claude-sonnet
    litellm_params:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
      api_key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
```

**MARS Agents**: Just call `localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions` → LiteLLM handles routing

---

## LiteLLM Benefits for MARS

**1. Vendor Independence**:
- Switch providers without code changes
- Use AskSage on classified, Anthropic on unclass
- Fallback to local Ollama if network down

**2. Unified Interface**:
- All agents use same API (OpenAI format)
- No vendor-specific code
- Simplified agent development

**3. Cost Optimization**:
- Route expensive calls to cheaper models
- Load balancing across providers
- Usage tracking and quotas

**4. Security & Compliance**:
- Single point of authentication
- Centralized audit logging
- API key rotation without code changes

**5. Air-Gap Readiness**:
- Swap AskSage → Ollama (config change only)
- No agent code modifications
- Seamless transition to offline operation

---

## LiteLLM Configuration Example

**MARS uses 3 providers simultaneously**:

```yaml
# litellm-config.yaml
model_list:
  # AskSage (DoD classified work)
  - model_name: gpt-4-asksage
    litellm_params:
      model: azure/gpt-4
      api_base: https://capra.flankspeed.dso.mil/v1
      api_key: os.environ/ASKSAGE_API_KEY

  # Anthropic (unclassified work)
  - model_name: claude-sonnet
    litellm_params:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
      api_key: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

  # Ollama (air-gap fallback)
  - model_name: local-llama
    litellm_params:
      model: ollama/llama3.1:70b
      api_base: http://localhost:11434
```

**Agent Code** (same for all):
```python
import openai
client = openai.OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:4000/v1")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-sonnet",  # LiteLLM routes appropriately
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this data"}]
)
```

**No vendor-specific code!**

---

## AskSage Authentication Flow

**Challenge**: AskSage requires DoD PKI (CAC/ECA)

**MARS Solution**:

**1. Manual Token Acquisition** (one-time setup):
```bash
# User authenticates with CAC/ECA via browser
# Receives JWT token (valid 30 days)
export ASKSAGE_API_KEY="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc..."

# Saved in mars-env.config (sourced at session start)
```

**2. LiteLLM Token Refresh** (automatic):
```yaml
# litellm-config.yaml
general_settings:
  asksage_token_refresh:
    enabled: true
    refresh_endpoint: https://capra.flankspeed.dso.mil/auth/refresh
    refresh_interval: 86400  # 24 hours
```

**3. Fallback to Anthropic** (if token expires):
```python
# LiteLLM automatically tries alternate providers
# Config: fallbacks = ["claude-sonnet", "local-llama"]
```

**Result**: Minimal user intervention, seamless failover

---

# Sysbox: Secure Containers

---

## The Container Security Challenge

**Standard Docker** (privileged containers):
```
Container (runs as root inside)
    ↓ (has full system access)
Host Kernel
    ↓ (vulnerable to container escape)
Host Filesystem, Network, Devices
```

**Problem**: Root inside container = root on host (with escape exploits)

**Traditional Solutions**:
- **Rootless Docker**: Docker daemon runs as user (complex setup)
- **User Namespaces**: Map root → user (limited compatibility)
- **SELinux/AppArmor**: Mandatory access control (complex policies)

**MARS Solution**: **Sysbox** runtime

---

## What is Sysbox?

**Sysbox**: Container runtime that provides **system-level isolation**

**Key Feature**: Containers that **feel like VMs** but are still containers

**Magic Trick**:
- Container **thinks** it has full system access (systemd, Docker-in-Docker)
- Host **knows** container is isolated (UID/GID mapping, namespaces)
- Security **improved** (no privileged mode needed)

**Created by**: Nestybox (acquired by Docker, 2022)
**Used by**: GitLab CI (Docker-in-Docker), Tailscale (system containers)

---

## Docker Runtimes: Standard vs. Sysbox

**Standard Docker (runc runtime)**:
```
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock myimage
```
- ⚠️ Container has **full Docker control** (can break out)
- ⚠️ Mounted `/var/run/docker.sock` = root on host

**Rootless Docker** (rootless daemon):
```
dockerd-rootless.sh
docker run myimage
```
- ✅ Docker daemon runs as user (no root)
- ❌ **Complex setup** (slirp4netns, uidmap, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR)
- ❌ **Limited features** (no privileged ports, no systemd)

**Sysbox Runtime** (MARS approach):
```
docker run --runtime=sysbox-runc myimage
```
- ✅ **Simple**: Standard Docker workflow
- ✅ **Secure**: UID/GID remapping automatic
- ✅ **Compatible**: Full Docker-in-Docker support
- ✅ **Systemd**: Works inside containers

---

## Sysbox Architecture

![Sysbox Architecture](diagrams/png/sysbox-architecture.png){ width=85% }

**How Sysbox Works**:

**Layer 1: Host Docker Daemon** (runs as root, manages containers)
```
dockerd (system daemon, TCP socket at localhost:9088)
```

**Layer 2: Sysbox Runtime** (intercepts container creation)
```
sysbox-runc (OCI runtime)
    ↓ (creates user namespace)
sysbox-fs (FUSE filesystem)
    ↓ (emulates /proc, /sys)
sysbox-mgr (resource management)
```

**Layer 3: Container** (isolated environment)
```
Container sees: UID 0 (root), full /proc, /sys, can run Docker
Host sees: UID 100000+ (unprivileged user), namespaced
```

**Key Insight**: Container **believes** it's privileged, but host **enforces** unprivileged operation

---

## DOCKER_HOST: Understanding Docker Sockets

**The Docker Socket Landscape**:

**1. System Docker Socket** (privileged):
```
/var/run/docker.sock (owned by root:docker)
```
- Default Docker daemon socket
- Requires `docker` group membership or root
- **MARS uses this** (via Sysbox isolation)

**2. Rootless Docker Socket** (user):
```
/run/user/1000/docker.sock (owned by user)
```
- Rootless daemon socket
- User-specific (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR)
- **MARS doesn't use** (too complex for multi-user)

**3. Remote Docker Socket** (TCP):
```
tcp://localhost:2375 (insecure)
tcp://localhost:2376 (TLS)
```
- Network-accessible Docker API
- Used for remote management
- **MARS uses TCP in dev** (localhost:9088 for mars-dev)

---

## MARS Docker Architecture

**MARS uses 2 Docker configurations**:

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="48%"}

**Production** (Sysbox):
```
DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
DOCKER_RUNTIME=sysbox-runc
```

**Benefits**:
- System Docker daemon
- Sysbox security isolation
- Standard workflow

**Use Case**:
- Research deployments
- Multi-user environments
- Classified networks

::::
:::: {.column width="48%"}

**Development** (mars-dev):
```
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:9088
DOCKER_RUNTIME=sysbox-runc
```

**Benefits**:
- Isolated from system Docker
- Won't interfere with host
- Safe for experimentation

**Use Case**:
- Building MARS itself
- Testing infrastructure
- Parallel dev environments

::::
:::::

**Key Point**: Same Sysbox runtime, different daemon endpoints

---

## Docker Image Caching: Sysbox Behavior

**Challenge**: Sysbox uses **per-container** image stores

**Standard Docker** (shared cache):
```
/var/lib/docker/
├── image/          # All containers share images
├── overlay2/       # Shared layers
└── containers/     # Container-specific data
```
**Sysbox** (isolated cache):
```
/var/lib/sysbox/
├── container-1/
│   └── var/lib/docker/  # Container 1's images
├── container-2/
│   └── var/lib/docker/  # Container 2's images (duplicate!)
└── container-3/
    └── var/lib/docker/  # Container 3's images (duplicate!)
```

**Implication**: Each Sysbox container has **own Docker image cache**

---

## Image Caching: MARS Optimization

**Problem**: 3 containers × 2 GB images = 6 GB storage waste

**MARS Solution**: Strategic image caching

**Approach 1: Pre-pull in Host**:
```bash
# On host (before creating Sysbox containers)
docker pull python:3.11-slim
docker pull node:20-alpine
docker pull postgres:15

# Sysbox containers inherit from /var/lib/docker/
# (via sysbox-fs mount magic)
```

**Approach 2: Shared Volume** (experimental):
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  mars-dev:
    runtime: sysbox-runc
    volumes:
      - docker-cache:/var/lib/docker:ro  # Read-only shared cache
```

**Approach 3: Build Once, Run Many**:
```bash
# Build MARS images on host
docker build -t mars/litellm:latest -f litellm/Dockerfile .

# Sysbox containers can docker pull from host registry
# (if registry is accessible)
```

**Current MARS Status**: Uses Approach 1 (pre-pull) + periodic cleanup

---

## Sysbox vs. Rootless Docker: Comparison

| Feature | **Sysbox** (MARS) | **Rootless Docker** |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | ✅ Simple (install runtime) | ❌ Complex (daemon setup) |
| **Docker-in-Docker** | ✅ Full support | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Systemd Support** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Privileged Ports** | ✅ Yes (remapped) | ❌ No (>1024 only) |
| **UID Mapping** | ✅ Automatic | ⚠️ Manual config |
| **Image Caching** | ⚠️ Per-container | ✅ Shared |
| **Security** | ✅ Strong isolation | ✅ Strong isolation |
| **Multi-User** | ✅ Works well | ⚠️ Per-user daemon |

**Why MARS chose Sysbox**: Simpler setup, full Docker features, better multi-user

---

## Sysbox in MARS: Practical Example

**Scenario**: Running MARS development environment (E6)

**Without Sysbox** (privileged container):
```bash
docker run --privileged \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  mars/dev:latest

# ⚠️ Container can:
# - Access host Docker daemon (full control)
# - Escape to host via vulnerabilities
# - Read/write host filesystem
```

**With Sysbox** (MARS approach):
```bash
docker run --runtime=sysbox-runc \
  mars/dev:latest

# ✅ Container can:
# - Run Docker inside (isolated daemon)
# - Use systemd (process manager)
# - Feel like full system
#
# ❌ Container cannot:
# - Access host Docker daemon
# - Break out to host
# - See other containers' data
```

**Security Gain**: **Defense in depth** without functionality loss

---

# Git Submodules

---

## The Dependency Management Challenge

**MARS has 2 types of dependencies**:

**1. Research Project Dependencies** (outward):
- How do research projects **use** MARS?
- Where does MARS code live in research repos?
- How to update MARS version?

**2. MARS Internal Dependencies** (inward):
- How does MARS **use** external tools (LiteLLM, GitLab MCP, Zotero)?
- How to version-control external dependencies?
- How to ensure reproducible builds?

**Solution**: Git submodules (both directions)

---

## What are Git Submodules?

**Git Submodule**: A git repository embedded inside another git repository

**Visual Concept**:
```
Main Repository (research-project/)
├── .git/                 # Main repo's git metadata
├── src/
│   ├── algorithms/       # Your research code
│   └── framework/        # MARS (git submodule)
│       ├── .git/         # MARS's git metadata (pointer)
│       └── core/         # MARS source code
└── .gitmodules           # Submodule configuration
```

**Key Properties**:
- **Specific commit**: Submodule tracks exact MARS version (e.g., commit abc123)
- **Independent history**: MARS and research-project have separate git histories
- **Reproducible**: `git clone --recursive` gets exact versions

---

## Git Submodules: How Research Projects Use MARS

![Git Submodules - Research Project](diagrams/png/git-submodules-research.png){ width=85% }

**Research Project Structure**:
```
battery-research/                    # Your research repository
├── .git/
├── .gitmodules                      # Defines MARS submodule
├── src/
│   ├── framework/                   # MARS (git submodule)
│   │   ├── core/
│   │   ├── modules/
│   │   └── bin/mars                 # MARS CLI
│   └── battery_sim/                 # Your research code
├── data/                            # Your research data
├── results/                         # Your experiment results
└── README.md
```

**.gitmodules file**:
```ini
[submodule "src/framework"]
    path = src/framework
    url = https://github.com/nasa/mars-v2.git
    branch = v1.0
```

**Setup** (one-time):
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/nasa/mars-v2.git src/framework
git commit -m "Add MARS framework as submodule"
```

---

## Submodules: Research Project Workflow

**Initial Clone** (new team member):
```bash
# Clone research project
git clone https://gitlab.example.com/research/battery-sim.git
cd battery-sim

# Initialize submodules (gets MARS)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Result: src/framework/ now contains MARS
```

**Update MARS Version**:
```bash
# Navigate to MARS submodule
cd src/framework

# Pull latest MARS changes
git pull origin main

# Return to research project
cd ../..

# Commit updated MARS version
git add src/framework
git commit -m "Update MARS to v1.1"
```

**Benefit**: Research project tracks **exact MARS version** (reproducible results)

---

## Git Submodules: How MARS Uses External Dependencies

![Git Submodules - MARS Dependencies](diagrams/png/git-submodules-mars.png){ width=85% }

**MARS Repository Structure**:
```
mars-v2/                             # MARS repository
├── .git/
├── .gitmodules                      # Defines 5 external dependencies
├── core/
├── modules/
├── external/                        # External dependencies (submodules)
│   ├── litellm/                     # Git submodule → LiteLLM fork
│   ├── gitlab-mcp/                  # Git submodule → GitLab MCP fork
│   ├── zotero-selfhost/             # Git submodule → Zotero Docker
│   ├── claude-extractor/            # Git submodule → Session exporter
│   └── generic-infra/               # Git submodule → Infrastructure patterns
└── bin/
```

**Why Submodules for External Dependencies?**
- ✅ **Version locking**: MARS tracks exact commit of each dependency
- ✅ **Reproducible builds**: `git clone --recursive` gets everything
- ✅ **Offline development**: All dependencies in one clone
- ✅ **Fork management**: MARS uses forks with custom patches

---

## MARS External Dependencies

**5 External Repositories** (all managed as submodules):

| Dependency | Type | Purpose | Fork? |
|------------|------|---------|-------|
| **LiteLLM** | Python/Docker | AI gateway (AskSage/CAPRA) | ✅ Yes (AskSage provider) |
| **GitLab MCP** | Node.js MCP | 79 GitLab tools | ✅ Yes (fixes/features) |
| **Zotero Server** | Docker Compose | Self-hosted Zotero | ❌ No (upstream) |
| **Zotero MCP** | Python MCP | Literature mgmt tools | ✅ Yes (10 tools) |
| **Claude Extractor** | Python CLI | CCC session export | ❌ No (upstream) |
| **Generic Infra** | Patterns | Reusable infra templates | ✅ Yes (extracted from MARS) |

**Setup**:
```bash
# One command gets all dependencies
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nasa/mars-v2.git
```

---

## Submodules: MARS Update Workflow

**Update External Dependency**:

**Scenario**: LiteLLM releases new version with bug fixes

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Navigate to submodule
cd external/litellm

# Check current commit
git log --oneline -1
# Output: abc123 Add AskSage provider support

# Pull upstream changes
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Test changes
cd ../..
pytest tests/test_litellm_integration.py

# Commit updated submodule
git add external/litellm
git commit -m "Update LiteLLM to v1.2.3 (bug fixes)"
```

**Benefit**: Controlled dependency updates, full testing before integration

---

## Submodules vs. Package Managers

**Why not use pip/npm/docker pull?**

| Approach | **Git Submodules** | **Package Managers** |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Offline** | ✅ Works (bundled) | ❌ Needs internet |
| **Reproducibility** | ✅ Exact commit | ⚠️ Version ranges |
| **Custom Patches** | ✅ Easy (fork) | ❌ Hard (patch files) |
| **Air-Gap** | ✅ Full support | ❌ Requires registry |
| **Version Lock** | ✅ Explicit commit | ⚠️ Lock files (can drift) |
| **Security Review** | ✅ Full source visible | ⚠️ Binary/compiled |

**MARS Choice**: Submodules for **critical dependencies**, package managers for **libraries**

**Example**:
- `external/litellm/` → **Submodule** (custom AskSage provider)
- `pip install requests` → **Package manager** (standard library)

---

## Submodules: Common Workflows

**1. Initial Setup** (new MARS deployment):
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nasa/mars-v2.git
cd mars-v2
./mars-dev/scripts/setup-external-deps.sh
```

**2. Update All Submodules**:
```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

**3. Check Submodule Status**:
```bash
git submodule status
# Output shows commit hash and branch for each submodule
```

**4. Work on Submodule** (develop patch):
```bash
cd external/litellm
git checkout -b fix/asksage-streaming
# Make changes, test, commit
git push origin fix/asksage-streaming
# Return to MARS, update submodule reference
cd ../..
git add external/litellm
git commit -m "Update LiteLLM with AskSage streaming fix"
```

---

## Submodules: Best Practices (MARS Approach)

**1. Pin to Specific Commits** (not branches):
```bash
# Good: Reproducible
cd external/litellm
git checkout abc123  # Specific commit
cd ../..
git add external/litellm

# Avoid: Can change unexpectedly
git submodule update --remote  # Pulls latest, may break
```

**2. Test Before Updating**:
```bash
# Update submodule
cd external/litellm && git pull

# Run tests
cd ../.. && pytest tests/test_litellm_*.py

# Only commit if tests pass
git add external/litellm && git commit -m "..."
```

**3. Document Dependencies**:
```yaml
# external-dependencies.yaml
dependencies:
  litellm:
    type: git-submodule
    path: external/litellm
    commit: abc123
    purpose: AskSage/CAPRA AI gateway
    status: Production
```

---

## Submodules: MARS Dependency Graph

```
Research Project (battery-sim)
    ↓ (git submodule)
MARS v2 (mars-v2)
    ↓ (5 git submodules)
    ├── LiteLLM (AI gateway)
    ├── GitLab MCP (project mgmt)
    ├── Zotero MCP (literature)
    ├── Zotero Server (self-hosted)
    └── Generic Infra (patterns)
```

**Reproducibility Chain**:
1. Research project pins MARS commit (e.g., v1.0.2)
2. MARS pins dependency commits (LiteLLM abc123, GitLab xyz789)
3. `git clone --recursive` = **exact versions, always**

**Air-Gap Capability**:
- Single clone = all dependencies (no network needed)
- Tarball distribution = fully offline installation
- Security review = all source code visible

---

## Submodules: Troubleshooting

**Problem 1**: Submodule not initialized
```bash
# Symptom: external/litellm/ is empty
# Fix:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Problem 2**: Submodule detached HEAD
```bash
# Symptom: (HEAD detached at abc123)
# Fix (if you want to track a branch):
cd external/litellm
git checkout main
git pull
cd ../..
git add external/litellm
```

**Problem 3**: Merge conflicts in submodule
```bash
# Symptom: Conflict in submodule pointer
# Fix:
cd external/litellm
git status  # See what's conflicting
# Resolve, then:
cd ../..
git add external/litellm
```

**Separation of Concerns**

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="30%"}

### mars-rt
**Runtime CLI**

**Purpose**: Run research projects

**Users**: Research teams

**Commands**:
- `mars up` - Deploy services
- `mars agents list`
- `mars services info`

**Location**: Production/research environments

::::
:::: {.column width="30%"}

### mars-dev
**Development CLI**

**Purpose**: Build MARS itself

**Users**: MARS developers

**Commands**:
- `mars-dev up` - Start E6 container
- `mars-dev build`
- `mars-dev doctor`

**Location**: E6 dev container

::::
:::: {.column width="30%"}

### mars-user-plugin
**Personal Customization**

**Purpose**: Customize dev environment

**Users**: Individual developers

**Capabilities**:
- Dotfiles (.vimrc, .bashrc)
- Custom scripts
- IDE configs
- Lifecycle hooks

**Location**: `external/mars-user-plugin/`

::::
:::::

---

## mars-user-plugin: Developer Experience Layer

**Problem**: Every developer has different preferences

**Solution**: Plugin system for personal customization

**Key Features**:

1. **Auto-Mount System**: Drop files → auto-mounted in E6 container
   ```
   external/mars-user-plugin/
   └── mounted-files/
       └── root/
           ├── .vimrc    (660 → rw mount)
           └── .bashrc   (640 → ro mount)
   ```

2. **Lifecycle Hooks**: Hook into mars-dev events
   - `pre-up.sh` - Before container starts
   - `container-startup.sh` - During startup
   - `post-build.sh` - After build completes

3. **Git-Tracked**: Personal configs tracked in separate repo
   - Share across MARS deployments
   - Version control your dev environment
   - Zero impact on mars-v2 repository

## Three-Layer Relationship

![Three-Layer Architecture](diagrams/png/three-layer-architecture.png)

**Key Principle**: Clean separation
- **mars-rt**: What research teams use
- **mars-dev**: How we build MARS
- **mars-user-plugin**: How each developer personalizes their workflow

---

## mars-user-plugin: Quick Start

**5-Minute Setup**

```bash
# 1. Clone plugin template
cp -r external/mars-user-plugin-template ~/dev/mars-user
cd ~/dev/mars-user

# 2. Add your dotfiles
cp ~/.vimrc mounted-files/root/.vimrc
chmod 660 mounted-files/root/.vimrc  # rw mount

# 3. Register with mars-dev
cd ~/dev/mars-v2
mars-dev register-plugin ~/dev/mars-user

# 4. Rebuild E6 container
mars-dev down
mars-dev build --no-cache
mars-dev up -d

# 5. Your dotfiles are now in E6!
mars-dev exec bash
vim  # Uses your .vimrc configuration
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Personal preferences without polluting mars-v2
- ✅ Share configs across MARS deployments
- ✅ Version control your dev environment
- ✅ Zero learning curve (just drop files)
